## Introduction

The Color Palette is a Python-based application that simplifies color management. It offers a user-friendly interface for adding, organizing, and copying colors. With session data storage, you can conveniently restore your color palette from previous sessions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/art3mistical/color-palette.git`
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `python3 main.py`
4. Start organizing your color palette with ease!

## How it Works

1. The app provides an intuitive UI with a color grid.
2. You can add colors to your palette by clicking the "+" button.
3. Colors are organized in a grid layout based on your color count.
4. Right-clicking a color block opens a context menu to copy color values or remove the color.


## Example Usage

1. Click the "+" button to add a new color to your palette.
2. Right-click the added color to copy its HEX or RGBA values.
3. Click the "+" button to add more colors or right-click to remove colors.
